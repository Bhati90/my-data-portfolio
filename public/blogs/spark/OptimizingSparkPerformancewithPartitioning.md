# Optimizing Spark Performance with Partitioning

Apache Spark's performance heavily depends on how your data is distributed across the cluster. Proper partitioning can make the difference between a job that runs in minutes versus one that takes hours. In this post, we'll explore partitioning strategies that can dramatically improve your Spark applications' performance.

## Why Partitioning Matters

Partitioning determines how Spark distributes your data across executors. Good partitioning:

- Reduces data shuffling between nodes
- Enables parallel processing
- Prevents data skew
- Optimizes memory usage

Without proper partitioning, you might experience:
- Slow job execution
- Out of memory errors
- Uneven executor workload

## Basic Partitioning Operations

### Repartitioning

```python
# Repartition to 200 partitions
df = df.repartition(200)

# Repartition by column
df = df.repartition("country")

# Repartition by multiple columns
df = df.repartition("country", "department")
